# Test CGI Linnea Martinsdotter
 
* The goal was to create a webpage for a REST-API. The webpage was supposed to include a table with information about the employees.

* I created the list with options from the API using a function which retrived the name and the surname for each employee. Following when an employee is chosen in the list, another function retrives the information from the API for the business card and prints it in a table format.

* The only thing that is needed to be able to start the application is an updated web browser and the .html-file and js.file in the same folder. The script was written in Visual Studio Code.
